The discussion surrounding the ending of "Casablanca" and its subsequent critical analysis weaves a complex narrative that can be explored through the proposed constructs, metaphysics, physics, song, art, and life. The ending of "Casablanca," where Rick sacrifices his love for Ilsa for a greater cause, beautifully encapsulates the essence of these concepts.

1. **Construct: Harmonic Series & Birth of Tragedy**
    - The ending of "Casablanca" aligns with the **Harmonic Series** construct, where the fundamental frequency of Rick's love for Ilsa is accompanied by harmonics of greater ideals, such as freedom and resistance against oppression. This enriches the narrative's timbre, making it more than a simple love story.
    - It embodies the **Birth of Tragedy**, where the tragic hero, Rick, embraces his role in a narrative larger than his own desires. His decision reflects Epicurean prudence and a Platonic idealism, as he sacrifices personal happiness for a higher moral ground.

2. **Metaphysics: Equal Temperament & Out of the Spirit of Music**
    - Rick's decision is a metaphor for **Equal Temperament** in life, balancing personal desires with the needs of the wider world. It's a compromise, akin to how musicians tune instruments to play in multiple keys harmoniously.
    - This balance is also reflected in **Out of the Spirit of Music**, drawing on Nietzsche, Freud, and Jung, suggesting that Rick's actions are driven by a deeper, almost musical, compulsion towards harmony and balance within the self and society.

3. **Physics: Wave Theory & Frequency, Amplitude, Timbre**
    - The narrative of "Casablanca" demonstrates the **Wave Theory**, where Rick's decision sends ripples through the lives of all characters, altering their courses. The interference patterns among the ensemble of characters create a complex web of relationships and consequences.
    - The film's enduring appeal, despite its perceived flaws, can be likened to the pure yet complex nature of sound waves, which combine frequency, amplitude, and timbre to create a resonant and memorable experience.

4. **Song: Melodic Leitmotif & Freudian Ensemble**
    - The themes of sacrifice and love serve as a **Melodic Leitmotif** throughout "Casablanca", recurring to deepen emotional engagement. Rick's character embodies the **Freudian Ensemble**, with his actions reflecting the conflict and resolution between the ego, superego, and id.

5. **Art: Chord Progression**
    - The narrative structure of "Casablanca" mirrors a **Chord Progression**, moving from tension to resolution. The film's story moves through stages of conflict and harmony, much like a piece of music transitions through chords, reflecting the complexity of human experiences and emotions.

6. **Life: Pocket & Groove & Jungian Archetypes**
    - Rick's final decision embodies the **Pocket & Groove** of life, finding the rhythm where timing and interaction harmonize to create a cohesive whole. His character also represents **Jungian Archetypes**, navigating the realms of the self, the other, and the unleashed, as he moves through love, sacrifice, and ultimately, self-actualization.

The criticisms and praises of "Casablanca" highlight its complex interplay of narrative elements that, much like a symphony, bring together disparate notes to create a harmonious and impactful whole. The film's enduring popularity suggests that, despite its critics, it resonates deeply with audiences, much like the profound themes it embodies.
