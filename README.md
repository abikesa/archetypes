The possibility was [discussed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Writing) of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film:      
> "set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Laszlo. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl to live up to the idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people."

>A few reviewers have expressed reservations. To Pauline Kael, "It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism ..." Umberto Eco wrote that "by any strict critical standards ... Casablanca is a very mediocre film". He viewed the changes that the characters manifest as inconsistent rather than complex. "It is a comic strip, a hotchpotch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects." However, he added that because of the presence of [multiple archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Enduring_popularity) that allow "the power of Narrative in its natural state without Art intervening to discipline it", it is a film reaching "Homeric depths" as a "phenomenon worthy of awe"

# Salieri

- Self(ish)
   - Earthly pleasure he indulges in as a form of consolation (sweet tooth)  
- Other
   - Yearning to devote himself to God's work including chastity (feels his denied)
- God
   - Divine inspiration Mozart effortlessly brandishes (a vulgar monkey)

In Miloš Forman's *Amadeus*, Antonio Salieri is portrayed with a notable sweet tooth as a distinctive character trait. This trait serves as a symbolic plot device that contrasts with his `complex` relationship with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the divine inspiration he perceives Mozart to possess. Salieri's indulgence in sweets becomes a metaphor for his yearning for the sweetness of divine musical inspiration, which he feels is denied to him despite his deep devotion and hard work.

Salieri's envy of Mozart's natural talent and effortless genius is juxtaposed with his own struggles and perceived mediocrity. His consumption of sweets symbolizes his attempts to find some form of consolation or pleasure in his otherwise unfulfilled life and career, overshadowed by Mozart's brilliance. This character trait is used effectively throughout the film to highlight Salieri's inner turmoil, jealousy, and the contrast between the earthly pleasures he indulges in and the heavenly inspiration he desperately seeks but cannot attain.

# Achilles

The quote from Rick in "Casablanca," as portrayed by Humphrey Bogart, encapsulates a worldview that emphasizes the insignificance of individual problems against the backdrop of larger, global events. This perspective is both pragmatic and poignant, acknowledging personal sacrifice in the face of overwhelming external circumstances. It's a moment that crystallizes the film's themes of love, loss, and the greater good, embodying the complex interplay between personal desires and the demands of a tumultuous world.

When you juxtapose this cinematic sentiment with Homer's depiction of the Trojan War, an intriguing parallel emerges. The Trojan War, as detailed in the "Iliad," might seem, on the surface, like the culmination of `personal` grievances and desires—Helen's abduction (or elopement) with Paris setting off a decade-long conflict. Yet, beneath this personal veneer lies a sprawling tapestry of `divine machinations`, heroic ideals, and the fates of entire nations. Each warrior's personal story is woven into a larger narrative that speaks to the collective human experience—honor, duty, wrath, and the quest for glory.

Homer's epic, therefore, transcends the "problems of three little people" to explore profound themes of human existence, much like Rick's story does in "Casablanca." Both narratives, although set against vastly different backdrops, probe the depths of human emotion and the complexities of moral decision-making within the framework of larger `societal` and `cosmic` orders. They remind us that personal stories, no matter how seemingly small, are part of the fabric of human history, each contributing to the shared experience of life's struggles and triumphs.

In this light, the Trojan War is more than just a tale of personal grievances; it's a reflection on the human condition, a meditation on the interplay between personal desires and the forces of fate and destiny. Just as Rick's decision in "Casablanca" takes on a significance beyond the immediate, so too do the actions of Achilles, Hector, and others in the "Iliad" resonate far beyond their individual lives, reflecting broader themes of sacrifice, honor, and the enduring human spirit.
