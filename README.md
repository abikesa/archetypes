The possibility was [discussed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Writing) of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film:      
> "set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Laszlo. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl to live up to the idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people."

>A few reviewers have expressed reservations. To Pauline Kael, "It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism ..." Umberto Eco wrote that "by any strict critical standards ... Casablanca is a very mediocre film". He viewed the changes that the characters manifest as inconsistent rather than complex. "It is a comic strip, a hotchpotch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects." However, he added that because of the presence of [multiple archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)#Enduring_popularity) that allow "the power of Narrative in its natural state without Art intervening to discipline it", it is a film reaching "Homeric depths" as a "phenomenon worthy of awe"

> Their [love triangle](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/casablanca-had-a-rocky-start-80-years-later-still-a-classic-from-the-archives)— scandalous for Hollywood at the time — fuels the tension of the movie as a succession of desperate refugees visit Rick’s Café Américain in Morocco while trying to escape the viciousness of Nazi-occupied Europe

# Salieri

- Self(ish)
   - Earthly pleasure he indulges in as a form of consolation (sweet tooth)  
- Other
   - Yearning to devote himself to God's work including chastity (feels his denied)
- God
   - Divine inspiration Mozart effortlessly brandishes (a vulgar monkey)

In Miloš Forman's *Amadeus*, Antonio Salieri is portrayed with a notable sweet tooth as a distinctive character trait. This trait serves as a symbolic plot device that contrasts with his `complex` relationship with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the divine inspiration he perceives Mozart to possess. Salieri's indulgence in sweets becomes a metaphor for his yearning for the sweetness of divine musical inspiration, which he feels is denied to him despite his deep devotion and hard work.

Salieri's envy of Mozart's natural talent and effortless genius is juxtaposed with his own struggles and perceived mediocrity. His consumption of sweets symbolizes his attempts to find some form of consolation or pleasure in his otherwise unfulfilled life and career, overshadowed by Mozart's brilliance. This character trait is used effectively throughout the film to highlight Salieri's inner turmoil, jealousy, and the contrast between the earthly pleasures he indulges in and the heavenly inspiration he desperately seeks but cannot attain.
